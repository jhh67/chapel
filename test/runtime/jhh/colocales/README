This directory contains unit tests for heterogenious processing unit support.
The tests are based on Python's unittest and are contained in cpuKinds.py.
The tests invoke the "cpuKind" executable, which is created by compiling
cpuKind.chpl with the "--library" argument to produce a library that is
linked against the cpuKind.c test harness. The sub_test script simply runs
all *.py files in this directory. The *.xml files contain hwloc descriptions
of the machine topologies used in the tests; alderLake.xml has heterogeneous
cores while milan.xml does not. As a result, these tests may be run on any
machine.
