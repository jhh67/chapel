This directory contains the meta-data files required for running GASNet unit tests,
among others, within the automated "pagoda test harness".
For information on the test harness, contact gasnet-staff@lbl.gov

None of the files in this directory or its children are intended for stand-alone testing.

gasnet-tests: harness driver for the GASNet unit tests, and some misc checking targets

libgasnet: harness drivers for testing builds of the GASNet library under a wide range
of conditions, such as with pedantic compiler options or differing configure options.

amudp/ammpi: harness drivers for the AMUDP/AMMPI unit tests. These assume the corresponding
GASNet conduit has been configured in.

external-*: harness drivers for "smoke testing" with various GASNet clients
