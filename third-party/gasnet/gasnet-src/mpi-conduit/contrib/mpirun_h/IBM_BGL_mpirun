  -label                        Add labels (STDOUT, STDERR, and MPI Rank) to the job output.
  -nw                           Return MPIRUN job cycle status instead of the job exit status.
  -nofree                       Do not deallocate the partition if MPIRUN had allocated it.
  -noallocate                   Do not allocate the partition.  The job will only start
                                if the partition was already in the Initialized state.
